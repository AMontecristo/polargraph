#summary All the things you need to build a polargraph
=Polargraph is made of:=
  * Arduino compatible processor
  * Adafruit Motorshield
  * 2x 400 step (0.9 degree) stepper motor that draw less than 600mA each. Voltage isn't that important.
  * Motor bracket parts in 3mm plywood (http://code.google.com/p/polargraph/downloads/list)
  * A few metres of beaded blind cord - 12mm pitch, 4.5mm bead size.
  * 2x beaded cord sprockets (3d printed http://www.shapeways.com/model/330572/2x_wide_polargraph_sprockets_5mm_axle.html)
  * 3x 6003Z sealed bearings (10mm wide, 39mm outside diameter)
  * Brass tube 17mm outside diameter, about 45mm long
  * Gondola parts in 3mm acrylic (http://code.google.com/p/polargraph/downloads/list)
  * Ballast (bags of nuts mostly)

=Advanced polargraph hardware=
Currently testing SD card with:
  * Arduino Mega
  * Adafruit Datalogger shield

Though neither of these are necessarily the best tools for the job, they are among the most simple to set up.
